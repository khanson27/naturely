Hello and welcome to my project page! 

Naturely is a React Native and Firebase full stack mobile application created from scratch, made by a team of 5 including myself. It is a photo sharing social media application where the focus is on location services using Google Maps so users can share where they have taken photos so the community can scope out where is good to go to spot wildlife and nature more generally.
This was inspired heavily by the Coronavirus pandemic and a need to get out after being cooped up for so long and we felt it would be a wholesome and interesting project to work on. I hope you enjoy it!

## SET UP

_To proceed with the following you will need to have a code editor downloaded and install some dependencies._

**1.** To clone this project from GitHub select the green 'Code' button and copy the https link into your terminal, using command `git clone https://https://github.com/khanson27/naturely.git`. You should then be able to boot it up in your code editor to look it over by changing directory to the newly cloned repository. All associated files on this repo should then be available to you locally.

**2.** In order to get the project running locally as intended you will need to install npm dependencies via your terminal in your code editor. Using command `npm i` this should install all dependencies needed.

**3.**  After all relevant dependencies are installed you should be able to run the application on Expo. The project was made primarily to run on Android systems, so if ran on iPhone some features may be slightly buggy. You should how ever be able to run it on a mobile emulator on the web with no issues.

**4.** Give it a whirl!
